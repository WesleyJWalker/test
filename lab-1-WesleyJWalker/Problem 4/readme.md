# Problem 1.4 
Write a program that reads integers `user_num` and `div_num` as input, and outputs `user_num` divided by `div_num` three times using floor divisions. 

Ex. If the input is:

    2000
    2
the output is:

    1000 500 250

* Note: In Python 3, floor division discards fractions. Ex: 6 // 4 is 1 (the 0.5 is discarded).
