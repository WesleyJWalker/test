# Problem 1.5

Driving is expensive. Write a program with a car's gas mileage (miles/gallon) and the cost of gas (dollars/gallon) as floating-point input, and output the gas cost for 20 miles, 75 miles, and 500 miles.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:

`print(f'{your_value1:.2f} {your_value2:.2f} {your_value3:.2f}')`

Ex: If the input is:

    25.0
    3.1599

where the gas mileage is $\$25.0 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{gallon}}$ and the cost of gas is $\$3.1599 \text{ per gallon}$, the output is:

    2.53 9.48 63.20

Note: Real per-mile cost would also include maintenance and depreciation.
