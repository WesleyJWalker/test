# Problem 1.7

Given three floating-point numbers x, y, and z, output x to the power of z, x to the power of (y to the power of z), the absolute value of (x minus y), and the square root of (x to the power of z).

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:

`print(f'{your_value1:.2f} {your_value2:.2f} {your_value3:.2f} {your_value4:.2f}')`

Ex: If the input is:

    5.0
    1.5
    3.2

Then the output is:

    172.47 361.66 3.50 13.13
