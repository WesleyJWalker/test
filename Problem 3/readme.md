# Problem 1.3

Often times when we develop a program we want to use the output of the program to convey some meaning or clearly layout data. This often means we need to format the ouput.


For this problem, write a program that prints a formatted "No parking" sign as shown below.


      NO PARKING
    2:00 - 6:00 a.m.

* Note the first line has two leading spaces.
